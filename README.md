# md-demo-tile-cursor
A tile-based cursor demo for the Sega Megadrive/Genesis. This program demonstrates the combined use of PLANE_A, PLANE_B, and color 0 to create transparency effects in tiles. Additionally the movement achieved here demonstrates the controlled updating of tile positions on screen according to gamepad input.
